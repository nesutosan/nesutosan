- 👀 I’m a passionate Cloud & DevOps & SRE Engineering with a strong background in automating, optimizing, operation excellent, and streamlining deployment  infrastructure processes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning these skills to improve my skill to make software development, operation excellent and deployment as seamless as possible.
  - **Container Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes
  - **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CodeArts
  - **Configuration Management:** Ansible
  - **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Azure, GCP, Huawei Cloud, Alibaba Cloud
  - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform, AWS CloudFormation
  - **Monitoring and Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir, Loki, Promtail
  - **Programming:** Python, JavaScript, Go, Bash
  - **Version Control:** Git, GitHub, GitLab
  - **Collaboration:** Slack, Microsoft Teams
  - **DevOps Tools:** Jira, Clickup
- ⚒️ Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
  - **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a robust CI/CD pipeline using `Gitlab CI/CD` and `Jenkins`, allowing automatic builds and deployments for a microservices-based application.
  - **Infrastructure Automation:** Automated infrastructure provisioning and configuration management using `Terraform` and `Ansible`, reducing manual work and ensuring consistency.
  - **Kubernetes Cluster Setup:** Deployed a highly available Kubernetes cluster on _On-Premise_ and _Cloud Provider_ such as AWS, Azure, Huawei Cloud by using `Terraform` for infrastructure provisioning and `Ansible` for configuration management.
  - **Containerization:** Containerized legacy applications using `Docker`, improving scalability and portability.
  - **Observability:** Implemented `Prometheus`, `Grafana`, `Loki`, `Mimir`, `Tempo` for monitoring, tracing, logging and alerting, ensuring high availability and performance.
- 📝 I occasionally write about DevOps,cloud technologies and my hobby like book review on my [blog](https://nestpractice.com). Check it out to learn more about my experiences and insights.
